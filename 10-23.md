## Last few brokens / not working commands
add a command to take a completed todo and push it to devlog, this functionality exists in the backend but not as a terminal commmand
/assign command doesnt seem to be working correctly, i would assume /remove user from project also doesnt
/news
/view relationships / /view relationship "id" isnt clean
/add /edit wizard for subtask or relationships
/delete selector wizard
