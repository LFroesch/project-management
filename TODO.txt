Goal:

    A project management app with the custom backend having the ability to be accessed via web app, mobile & desktop app
    (Starting with a dual backend + webapp frontend project)
    The goal is to help guide a user from start to end on their projects, and have relevant organizational areas and
    framework / plugin suggestions / options in a flow chart sort of way / mixed with something like pcpartpicker where its kinda like "these work together" "these dont" etc
    The primary use is for people like myself that have so many projects going on they cant keep track of them in a cohesive way, including the ones from the past / their portfolio etc so it will have after completion projects and their respective links / cron job helps / potentially toggling on and / off the service via api calls to sites like render.com that are hosting (thats just a for instance)
    
    Prompt Tags:
