# Notes / To Do
- Finishing Touches on this section, move To Dos / Dev Log to new tab or something? Make todos be more fluid as a workflow

# Stack / Progress
- Make it so you can pick and choose from a big bank of options that are like red = styling, blue = database etc, but you can choose multiple in each if you so choose
- Add packages section that is the same thing a big bank of options of packages
- All of these *IN THE FRONT END* have associated const descriptions that will show to help the user pick between them / remember what they are
- Development Phases -> Progress Checkpoints (Different for different types of projects, templated)

# Docs / Features

# Future
- More collapsibility where it should be / better shadowing / layout / font sizing etc just some cleaning / Contrast
