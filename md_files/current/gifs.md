## 1. The Full LLM Workflow ðŸ”¥
This is your money shot. Show the complete loop:
- Type /summary prompt all in terminal
- Copy the output (show it in clipboard)
- Switch to ChatGPT/Claude tab, paste
- Show LLM generating batch commands
- Copy those commands
- Switch back, paste into terminal
- Watch them execute (show progress: "Executing 1/10...")
- Pan to the UI showing the project populated with todos, notes, components
Why: This is THE differentiator. Nobody else does this. Make it 20-30 seconds max.
