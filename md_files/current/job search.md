# Job Search Strategy - Day 0

**Date:** October 30, 2025 (Launch Day)
**Status:** App launching today, job search starts tomorrow
**Timeline:** 60 days to first offer (Nov 1 - Dec 31)

---

## TODAY (DAY 0): LAUNCH THE APP

Focus 100% on getting Dev Codex deployed. Job search starts tomorrow fresh.

**Today's Priority:**
- Railway setup (2-3 hours)
- Production testing (2-3 hours)
- Deploy and monitor (1 hour)

**After 5pm:** Rest. You're sick. Netflix and relax.

---

## TOMORROW (DAY 1): START JOB SEARCH

Wake up with a deployed app and start hunting. See "WEEK 1 PRIORITIES" below.

---

## THE CORE TRUTH

**You ARE valuable:**
- Built production SaaS with auth, payments, security, real-time features
- Understand systems, debugging, production concerns
- Can ship working features
- 1.5 years = ~6,000 hours of real coding

**Your weakness:**
- Abstract algorithm puzzles (NOT practical coding)
- This is ONE skill, not your entire ability

**The strategy:**
- Target companies that value builders over puzzle-solvers
- Learn JUST ENOUGH algorithms to pass basic screens
- Lead with your deployed project, not your resume

**You only need ONE company to say yes.**

---

## TARGET COMPANIES (IMPORTANT)

### ✅ Companies to FOCUS ON (They hire practical builders)

**Look for these in job postings:**
- "Take-home project"
- "Pair programming interview"
- "Build a feature"
- "Real-world problem solving"
- Startups < 50 people
- Agencies/consultancies
- "Full-stack" positions (less algorithm focus)

**Specific companies known for practical interviews:**
- Shopify (take-home projects)
- GitLab (remote, practical focus)
- Early-stage YC startups (workatastartup.com)
- Local agencies (search "[your city] web development agency")

### ❌ Companies to AVOID (Heavy algorithm testing)

**Red flags in job postings:**
- "Strong CS fundamentals required"
- "Data structures and algorithms expertise"
- "Coding challenge with multiple rounds"
- FAANG/Big Tech (save for later)

---

## MINIMAL ALGORITHM PREP

**You don't need to master algorithms. You need to pass SOME interviews.**

### The 5 Patterns That Cover 60% of Easy Problems

**Learn WHEN to use each, not every variation:**

**1. Hash Map (Fast Lookup)**
```javascript
// Use when: "Have I seen this before?" or "Find pairs"
const map = new Map();
for (let item of array) {
    if (map.has(target - item)) return true;
    map.set(item, index);
}
```
Problems: Two Sum, Contains Duplicate

---

**2. Two Pointers (Sorted Arrays)**
```javascript
// Use when: Sorted array, looking for pairs
let left = 0, right = array.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    if (array[left] + array[right] === target) return [left, right];
    else if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
}
```
Problems: Two Sum II, Valid Palindrome

---

**3. Sliding Window (Subarray Problems)**
```javascript
// Use when: "Find longest/shortest subarray that..."
let left = 0, maxLength = 0;
for (let right = 0; right < array.length; right++) {
    // Expand window
    // Shrink if invalid
    // Track max
}
```
Problems: Best Time to Buy Stock, Longest Substring

---

**4. Set (Uniqueness)**
```javascript
// Use when: Check duplicates or uniqueness
const set = new Set(array);
return set.size !== array.length; // has duplicates
```

---

**5. Basic Iteration**
```javascript
// When in doubt, just loop through
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // Do something
}
```

### Daily Practice (30-60 min/day)

**Week 1:** Do 2 easy problems/day (Neetcode.io or Leetcode Easy)
**Week 2:** Redo same problems, focus on speed
**Week 3:** Add 1 medium/day

**How to practice:**
1. Try problem for 15 minutes
2. If stuck, look at solution
3. Understand the PATTERN (not memorize code)
4. Redo from scratch
5. Explain out loud

**Use AI to learn:**
```
"I solved Two Sum. Here's my code: [paste]

1. What pattern is this?
2. When else would I use this pattern?
3. What variations exist?"
```

## INTERVIEW STRATEGIES

### Phone Screen

**"Tell me about yourself":**
> "I'm a full-stack engineer who built and deployed a production SaaS app.
> It handles authentication, payments, and real-time collaboration. I'm
> looking for a role where I can contribute to production features while
> learning from experienced engineers. Want me to walk through what I built?"

**"What's your experience?":**
> "I'm looking for my first full-time role, but I'm not a beginner. I built
> a production app with 400+ tests covering auth, payments, and security.
> I understand production concerns like rate limiting, CSRF, and webhook
> verification. I'm looking for a team where I can apply these skills and
> level up."

**"Biggest technical challenge?":**
> "When I implemented Stripe webhooks, I had to validate signatures before
> processing events - otherwise attackers could fake payments. I learned
> about cryptographic verification and also handled idempotency to prevent
> duplicate subscriptions if webhooks fire twice."

### Technical Screen

**If they give algorithm problem:**
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Explain your approach BEFORE coding
3. Write pseudocode/comments first
4. Code the solution
5. Test with examples
6. Discuss time/space complexity

**If you forget syntax:**
> "I know the approach - hash map for O(1) lookups - but let me verify
> the exact Map syntax real quick..."

**Most interviewers allow this. It shows thinking > memorization.**

**If it's a practical problem:**
- Relate to your project
- Think out loud about edge cases
- Ask about requirements/scale
- You'll crush these

### If You Struggle with Algorithms

**Be honest and pivot:**
> "I'll give this my best shot. Quick context - I'm strongest at building
> production features and system design. If I struggle here, I'd love to
> walk you through my project's architecture or solve a practical problem."

**Some will say yes. Those are YOUR companies.**

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### You Don't Need Perfect Syntax
- Senior engineers Google syntax daily
- Focus on patterns, not memorization
- Say "Let me check the syntax" in interviews
- Understanding > recall

### You Don't Need to Ace Every Interview
- You'll fail algorithm-heavy ones (expected)
- You'll pass practical ones (your strength)
- You only need ONE offer
- 5-10% success rate = normal

### You're Not Starting from Zero
- You have real skills companies need
- You built something 90% of candidates haven't
- First job is hardest
- After 1 year, interviews get WAY easier

### AI Usage
- ✅ Use for learning patterns
- ✅ Use for take-homes (if company allows)
- ✅ Use on the job
- ❌ Don't use in live coding interviews (you'll get caught)

### Your Real Value
- Systems thinking
- Production experience
- Shipping features
- Debugging real problems
- Security awareness
- Understanding trade-offs

**These matter more than algorithm skills long-term.**
