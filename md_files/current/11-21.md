### Launch Checklist (Next 24-48 Hours)
- [ ] "Highlighted" Terminal Tab Button while in terminal Mode (& on Mobile somehow?)
- [ ] Identified color space mismatch and proposed simplified solution.
    Found it! DaisyUI 4.x uses OKLCH color space, not HSL! You're trying to parse OKLCH values as HSL, which completely breaks the math.
    The format is: "lightness% chroma hue" not HSL. The fix is simple: Just use the OKLCH lightness value directly for contrast decisions. OKLCH lightness is perceptually uniform, making it perfect for this:
- [ ] **GIFs for README** - 3 key demos: LLM workflow, autocomplete, speed demo

- [ ] Ensure backups are setup
