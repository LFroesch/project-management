✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

  - test.yml - Runs all tests when you push code
  - deploy.yml - Automatically deploys to Digital Ocean when you push to main
  - Tests → Build → Deploy → Health Check → Smoke Tests

  ✅ Digital Ocean Configuration (.do/app.yaml)

  - Full app configuration for DO App Platform
  - Backend service (Node.js API)
  - Frontend service (React static site)
  - Environment variables setup
  - Health checks and auto-scaling
  - Security headers

  ✅ Health Check Endpoints

  - /api/health - Basic app status
  - /api/ready - Database connectivity check
  - /api/live - Load balancer check

  What YOU need to do:

  1. Digital Ocean Setup (5 minutes)

  # Create account at digitalocean.com
  # Go to Apps → Create App → GitHub
  # Connect your repo
  # It will use your .do/app.yaml automatically

  2. Add Secrets to GitHub (10 minutes)

  In your GitHub repo: Settings → Secrets → Actions, add:
  - DO_API_TOKEN (from DO dashboard)
  - DO_APP_NAME=dev-codex
  - MONGODB_URI (MongoDB Atlas connection string)
  - JWT_SECRET (any 64-char random string)

  3. MongoDB Atlas (5 minutes)

  - Create free cluster at cloud.mongodb.com
  - Whitelist IP: 0.0.0.0/0

  4. Deploy

  git push origin main
  # That's it. GitHub Actions does everything else.

  The whole CI/CD pipeline is ready. You just need accounts and keys.
