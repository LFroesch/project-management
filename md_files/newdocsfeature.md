# Documentation System - Future Enhancements

## Current Implementation (v1.0)

The current documentation system includes:
- **Feature grouping**: Optional `feature` field to group related docs
- **3-tab UI**: Structure (feature visualization), All Docs (list), Create New
- **Terminal integration**: `/add doc`, `/view docs`, `/edit doc` with feature support
- **LLM context**: Enhanced `/summary prompt` groups docs by features

This provides a simple, effective way to visualize project structure and relationships between documentation.

## Future Enhancement Ideas

These are potential improvements that could be implemented in future versions to make the documentation system even more powerful for managing complex codebases.

### 1. Relationship Tracking System

**Goal**: Automatically detect and visualize connections between different parts of the project.

**Features**:
- **Auto-linking**: Detect when docs reference other docs, todos, or tech stack items
  - Example: A "User Auth API" doc mentions "JWT token" → link to Auth tech
  - Example: A doc references a todo by text → show related todos
- **Cross-references**: Display bidirectional relationships
  - "This doc is referenced by 3 other docs"
  - "This doc references 2 todos and 1 tech item"
- **Dependency visualization**: Show what depends on what
  - Frontend components → Backend APIs they use → Database models

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface DocRelationship {
  docId: string;
  relatedDocs: string[];
  relatedTodos: string[];
  relatedTech: string[];
  relatedPackages: string[];
  detectedAt: Date;
}
```

**Terminal Commands**:
- `/analyze relationships [@project]` - Scan and detect all relationships
- `/view relationships [doc-id]` - Show what a doc connects to
- `/link doc [doc-id] [target-type] [target-id]` - Manually link items

---

### 2. Coverage Gap Analysis

**Goal**: Identify areas of the project that lack documentation.

**Features**:
- **Tech stack coverage**: Which technologies have no docs?
  - "React is in your stack but has no documented patterns"
  - "MongoDB has 1 Model doc but no query examples"
- **Feature coverage**: Which features are undocumented?
  - "Authentication feature has API docs but no ENV docs"
  - "Deployment feature is missing Runtime docs"
- **Type coverage**: Track documentation by type
  - Models: 5, Routes: 3, API: 2, Util: 0 ← Missing utility docs
- **Suggestions**: Recommend what docs to create
  - "Consider adding: Auth Runtime docs, Error handling Util docs"

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface CoverageAnalysis {
  byFeature: Record<string, {
    docTypes: DocType[];
    missingTypes: DocType[];
    score: number; // 0-100
  }>;
  byTech: Record<string, {
    hasDocs: boolean;
    docCount: number;
    suggestedDocs: string[];
  }>;
  overallScore: number;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

**Terminal Commands**:
- `/analyze coverage [@project]` - Generate coverage report
- `/gaps [@project]` - Quick view of what's missing
- `/suggest doc` - AI-powered doc suggestions based on gaps

---

### 3. Duplicate & Similarity Detection

**Goal**: Prevent documentation bloat and identify content that should be merged.

**Features**:
- **Duplicate detection**: Find docs with very similar content
  - "These 2 API docs are 85% similar - consider merging"
- **Title similarity**: Detect similar doc titles
  - "User Auth API" vs "User Authentication API" → Possible duplicate
- **Content overlap**: Identify when multiple docs cover the same topic
  - Extract key terms and find overlap percentage
- **Merge suggestions**: Recommend which docs to combine
- **Consolidation workflow**: Guided process to merge related docs

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface SimilarityMatch {
  doc1Id: string;
  doc2Id: string;
  titleSimilarity: number; // 0-100
  contentSimilarity: number; // 0-100
  overallScore: number;
  recommendation: 'merge' | 'review' | 'keep_separate';
  reason: string;
}
```

**Terminal Commands**:
- `/analyze duplicates [@project]` - Find similar docs
- `/merge doc [id1] [id2]` - Merge two docs into one
- `/compare doc [id1] [id2]` - Side-by-side comparison

---

### 4. Documentation Health Checks

**Goal**: Maintain high-quality, up-to-date documentation.

**Features**:
- **Freshness score**: Track when docs were last updated
  - "This doc hasn't been updated in 90 days - review recommended"
  - Color-code docs: Green (recent), Yellow (30+ days), Red (90+ days)
- **Completeness check**: Ensure docs have all important fields
  - "5 docs are missing feature grouping"
  - "3 docs have very short content (< 100 chars)"
- **Consistency validation**: Check for formatting issues
  - Detect inconsistent capitalization in titles
  - Flag docs without proper sections
- **Orphan detection**: Find docs not linked to anything
  - "This doc isn't in any feature group and has no relationships"
- **Quality metrics**: Overall documentation health score
  - Combines freshness, completeness, consistency, and coverage

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface HealthReport {
  totalDocs: number;
  healthScore: number; // 0-100
  issues: {
    stale: number;        // Not updated in 90+ days
    incomplete: number;   // Missing feature or short content
    orphaned: number;     // No feature, no relationships
    inconsistent: number; // Formatting issues
  };
  recommendations: {
    priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    message: string;
    docId?: string;
  }[];
}
```

**Terminal Commands**:
- `/health docs [@project]` - Full health report
- `/stale [@project]` - Show outdated docs
- `/orphans [@project]` - Find unconnected docs
- `/fix health [issue-type]` - Guided workflow to fix issues

### 5. Interactive Relationship Graphs

**Goal**: Visual representation of how documentation connects.

**Features**:
- **Graph visualization**: Interactive network graph showing connections
  - Nodes: Docs, features, tech, packages
  - Edges: Relationships, references, dependencies
  - Color-coded by type: Routes (blue), Models (green), API (orange), etc.
- **Zoom & filter**: Focus on specific features or types
  - "Show only Authentication feature docs and relationships"
  - "Hide tech stack, show only docs and todos"
- **Click navigation**: Click nodes to view doc details
- **Highlight paths**: Show connection paths between two items
  - "How does Frontend Component connect to Database Model?"
- **Export options**: Save graph as image or interactive HTML

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface GraphNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'doc' | 'feature' | 'tech' | 'package' | 'todo';
  label: string;
  color: string;
  size: number; // Based on # of connections
}

interface GraphEdge {
  source: string;
  target: string;
  type: 'references' | 'depends_on' | 'part_of';
  weight: number;
}
```

**UI Implementation**:
- Use D3.js or React Flow for graph rendering
- New "Graph" tab in DocsPage (4th tab)
- Toolbar for filtering, zooming, exporting
- Side panel showing node details on selection

**Terminal Commands**:
- `/graph [@project]` - Generate relationship graph data
- `/path [from] [to]` - Find connection path between two items

- **Feature templates**: Create entire feature documentation sets
  - "User Auth" → Generates Model, Route, API, ENV docs at once

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface DocTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  docType: DocType;
  content: string; // With {VARIABLE} placeholders
  variables: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    default?: string;
  }[];
}
```

**Terminal Commands**:
- `/template list` - Show available templates

## Notes

- All these features maintain the core principle: **simplicity first**
- Each enhancement should be optional - don't force complexity on users
- Terminal commands should remain concise and intuitive
- UI should stay clean and fast - no feature bloat
- Focus on features that solve real pain points in managing documentation
- Consider user feedback before implementing - not all features may be needed
